  <h3 class="intro-heading"> Rome. The Eternal City.</h3>
  
    <div class="paragraph1">
       <p> I decided to move to Rome as part of my study abroad program. I did not fully research the kosher scene prior to arriving. Are we noticing a theme here? I was immensely lucky in terms of kosher options, although a little more prep would have went a long way. </p>
    </div>
  <p> Italy in general is the place you go to EAT. Much like the Israeli/Jewish culture I am used to, the Italians communicate, love, express, and socialize via food. Food is comfort and something to take pride in. It immediately felt like home to me.</p>
  <p>Living in Rome is definitely different than visiting Rome. I had five wonderful roommates and they all probably thought I was crazy when I told them about the kosher diet I was on and how that meant I would use my own separate dishes, cook different foods, etc. They were extremely respectful and interested in what I had to say and interested in how it would work practically. So was I.</p>
  <p>In the apartment I brought one frying pan for my dairy set of dishes and one for my meat. As explained in the <b>“What is Kosher?”</b> section of the blog, a kosher kitchen requires one to have to sets of dishes for meat and dairy, respectively. So I had that much in place. In addition to a few knives and a peeler I picked up in the grocery store.</p>
  <p> Day 1 of my program, one of the administrative people at the school kindly asked me to join her to the grocery store to see if there was something I could find that was kosher. I think we found one package of crackers that tasted like stale Matza. And anyone who has tasted Matza knows that stale Matza must be pretty intense. Nonetheless I was so thankful that she cared to join me in the pursuit of all things kosher. We grabbed some other fruits and vegetables and returned to campus. The head of the abroad program was actually raised Jewish so she was helpful in connecting me to local kosher stores and the like. </p>

  <img src= "images/garbatella.JPG" id="garbatella">
  <p> For the duration of the Spring I lived in the Roman neighborhood of Garbatella. Garbatella is about three stops from the Coloseo (the Colloseum) and is a magnificent suburb of Rome. Originally built by Mussolini for his blue-collar workers, this town now has the classic Italian charm. I was looking for an experience that was culturally rich and purposefully placed among the native people. The program hosted 40 students that semester and we were the only Americans in this town which was impactful. That being said, any of the main kosher restaurants are about a 30 minute bus ride into the main city. The lead administrator found me a kosher butcher about a 20 minute walk from campus. Called Kosher Delight di Ouazana, this little kosher butcher shop had a storefront with various beef and chicken options to choose from. In my jetlagged state, I thought it was a mirage. Luckily some friends who I made quickly offered to help me transport the 15 pounds of meat I purchased. Yes, fifteen. As most Jewish people will tell you, we just have a thing with food and will buy it when we see it, especially in a new environment such as Rome.</p>
  <p> Okay, so I had meat and vegetables now. A few doors down from Ouazana, there was a tiny kosher store with random items to choose from. I bought the staples…oil, Israeli cheese, couscous, pesto, and handmade pasta. I was <b>SET</b>. </p>

  <p> Returning home with all my treasures in hand and a smile beaming of pride and excitement, I sat down and planned my first meal in Rome…pan roasted potatoes, grilled chicken with pesto, and salad. I felt like a Queen in her palace.  </p>
  <p> Over the course of the following few months I explored the City and ate at nearly all the kosher restaurants. The main street for all things kosher in Rome is in the Jewish Ghetto. The historical significance of the ghetto is of critical importance. The ghetto was where all Jews were forced to live in crowded, inhumane conditions during WWII and earlier. As a stark contrast, today the Jeish Ghetto is the most expensive area to live in Rome due to the modern-day Roman appreciation of its historical significance as well as the bustling restaurants and shops that line the streets.</p>

   <div class="box">
      <h3 class="intro-heading"> Some of my favorite Italian restaurants in the Ghetto include:</h3>
     
    <ol>
      <li><b> Ba Ghetto – </b><br>one of the most amaznig restaurants I have been to. <b>Period</b>. Definitely more of an upscale place, but the quality and food experience is second to none. They take pride in their meat selections and the Carciofi Ebraica (Jewish Artichoke) is divine. Flayed and fried, this whole artichoke dish is so good you will want another. This <a href ="https://food52.com/blog/10263-carciofi-alla-giudia-roman-jewish-style-artichokes" target="_blank"> article  </a> does the Carciofi Ebraica’s significance, and preparation, justice, and I did not regret it.</li>
      <li><b> Fonzie The Burger House – </b><br>although definitely not Italian style, this American style place was quite tasty when missing home. My favorite burger here was the one with the sunny side up egg on top. Definitely my favorite go-to meal when visiting the Jewish ghetto, but also a favorite of my non-kosher-keeping friends as well.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><i>**A note about the kosher status of certain restaurants in the Ghetto…some restaurants are indeed kosher and marked with a proper Hechsher (Jewish kosher certification document), while others may look kosher and even have Hebrew writing, but unfortunately they are not kosher at all. It is always important to triple check for a proper Hechsher, even for the recommendations I gave above as their status could have changed.</i>
