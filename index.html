      <p>Shalom~ </p><br>
      <p>I hope you are enjoying the Kosher Wanderer and all the information available for anyone with strict dietary guidelines, aching to travel the world. The whole idea for the blog came about when I was researching and asking my friends, "how do I keep kosher in a desolate place?". A lot of my friends had great suggestions, but I could not find a resource online outlining how to practically get this done. And that is where the Kosher Wanderer was born.</p>

      <p>Luckily in this world, there are many major cities with viable kosher options including markets and restaurants, but in order for this blog to be accurate, I had to push the limits. And I did. And it was hard. And it was frustrating. But, it was actually one of the most rewarding experiences I have had. I had no real guidelines, but was forced to make them for myself in the middle of Iceland. I documented the prep work and my day-to-day options to make for a (semi) healthy week abroad. Through this blog I hope to provide material for other adventurers who feel sometimes limited by their dietary needs. There is no need for a limit on adventure so join me in learning how :) </p>
    </div>

  <div class= "about box">
    <h3 class= "intro-heading">ABOUT:</h3>
    <p> Hello and welcome to the Kosher Wanderer. Yes, the Jews wandered in the desert for 40 years. Every pun is intended. Glad you made it.</p>
    <p> For starters as a disclaimer I wanted to outline what this blog is and what it is not, for reference.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="what-it-is box">
    <h3 class="intro-heading">WHAT IT IS:</h3>
    <p>- This blog is the first resource of its kind (that I could find) outlining what its like keeping kosher in a 1) foreign country with little kosher resources 2) for a substantial amount of time (8 days, including Sabbath)</p>
    <p>- This blog is meant to give inspiration for those willing to travel the world, but might be apprehensive in doing so because of the fear of difficulty of keeping kosher abroad</p>
    <p>- This blog is meant to be a springboard for creativity and finding random kosher items across the globe for people who love to travel AND eat (kosher).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="what-this-blog-is-not box">
    <h3 class="intro-heading">WHAT THIS BLOG IS NOT:</h3>
    <p>- This blog is not intended to be a one-size- fits-all and the author is not by any means a religious authority and local Orthodox Rabbis should be consulted on a case-by- case basis.</p>
    <p>- This blog is not intended to be adhered to strictly in terms of food options as these options listed were available to me during the time of the trip and in preparation for the trip. The posting of the food items does not endorse any brand nor type of food.
    </p>
    <p>- This blog is by no means intended to be deemed as “healthy” and the nutritional intake was not considered, but was instead thought of as providing nourishment during this time to suit my preferences and sustain me on my adventures.</p>
    <p>- This blog is not intended to portray kosher in a way of a be all end all situation. Judaism values life and in case of an emergency or life threatening situation, kosher laws can be accommodated. Again, please consult your Rabbi for this.</p>
  </div>

  <div class= "What-is-kosher box">
    <h3 class ="intro-heading">BUT FIRST, WHAT IS KOSHER?</h3>
    <p>Kosher is the Jewish set of laws pertaining to dietary restrictions. Coming from G-d at Mount Sinai, kosher laws outline what a Jewish person is to eat and how food is prepared. Some basic laws include </p>

    <ol>
      <li>prohibition of mixing milk and meat (and waiting in between eating each) </li>
      <li>eating land animals that chew their cud and have split hooves </li>
      <li>fish must have fins and scales </li>
      <li>birds eaten cannot be birds of prey. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Those are the basics. Then the laws go further into the preparation of food, how to keep a kosher kitchen, and so on. I encourage you to visit this  <a href="http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard_cdo/aid/113425/jewish/What-is-Kosher.htm"  target="_blank"> website </a> to learn more! But basically, keeping kosher is straightforward on most occasions and manageable when keeping it in one’s home or a place where a kitchen can be managed.</p>

Challah, or the braided bread, has a significant role in Jewish history. First cited in the Bible (Numbers 15:18-21), it is used in reference to the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and the offerings given there.</p>

The thickness of the Acai base gives it perfect weight to balance with the light toppings, complete with plenty of antioxidants. The Acai base I found that is kosher is Sambuzon. As always, please check each time you purchase to make sure items are still kosher. Enjoy!</p>

          <h4 class= "location"> Miami, FL</h4>
          <p>Zak the Baker…where do I begin. Zak has been baking for years and my family met him at a local Sunday market. They loved his bread and were hoping he would open shop. And he did!!! This kosher bakery is located in Wynwood Miami, a neighborhood being impacted by a sub-culture of food and fun. The walls of the neighborhood are decorated with graffiti art which really adds to the atmosphere. Zak the Baker takes food to a new level. He combines simple, fresh, and local ingredients into a magical dance on the palette. The base of most of his dishes is his famous sourdough bread. My personal favorite is the Ricotta Orange Toast. A thick slice of toast is topped with fresh ricotta, orange crème, and candied orange slices. It is simply unbelievable. He makes you forget you are walking into a kosher restaurant and makes the kosher crowd finally feel a little more mainstream. Seems silly, but it is hugely impactful and a delight to all. </p>

          <h4 class="location"> Washington, DC </h4>
          <p> In an attempt to start a frosting from scratch, I made royal icing for sugar cookies as an experiment. I managed to find kosher meringue powder (Wilton brand) and voila! This stuff hardens quickly, so be sure to work quickly and get any air bubbles out of the frosting before it sets. I would create a thin outline on the cookie using the frosting, let that set for 5 mins. I would then take a modest heap of the frosting in the center and work your way outwards, touching the edge. I adapted this recipe from one I found previously. The thing about icing is that it needs to be played with so feel free to add more sugar if the mixture is too thin. Trial and error. Check out the recipe <a href="recipe.html#making" target="_blank"> here</a>! </p>

      <div class="explanation">
        <p>This blog is especially close to my heart as I became kosher at the age of 12 on my own. Luckily my family has been supportive along the way, but it has definitely been a journey being one of the only Jewish students in my high school, the only student on my university campus receiving kosher meals (they have since instituted a kosher meal plan :)), and one of the only religious people at work. Through it all my faith has fueled me and I truly enjoy this practice of Judaism. My goal is to inspire others and let them know that they can in fact have their cake and eat it too :)</p>
