      <p>I hope you are enjoying the Kosher Wanderer and all the information available for anyone with strict dietary guidelines, aching to travel the world. The whole idea for the blog came about when I was researching and asking my friends, "how do I keep kosher in a desolate place?". A lot of my friends had great suggestions, but I could not find a resource online outlining how to practically get this done. And that is where the Kosher Wanderer was born...<a href ="intro_readmore"><a href="" target="_blank">read more </a> </p>

<!--
      <p>Luckily in this world, there are many major cities with viable kosher options including markets and restaurants, but in order for this blog to be accurate, I had to push the limits. And I did. And it was hard. And it was frustrating. But, it was actually one of the most rewarding experiences I have had. I had no real guidelines, but was forced to make them for myself in the middle of Iceland. I documented the prep work and my day-to-day options to make for a (semi) healthy week abroad. Through this blog I hope to provide material for other adventurers who feel sometimes limited by their dietary needs. There is no need for a limit on adventure so join me in learning how :) </p>

This kosher bakery is located in Wynwood Miami, a neighborhood being impacted by a sub-culture of food and fun...<a href ="intro_readmore"><a href="" target="_blank">read more</a></p>

      <p> In an attempt to start a frosting from scratch, I made royal icing for sugar cookies as an experiment. I managed to find kosher meringue powder (Wilton brand) and voila! This stuff hardens quickly, so be sure to work quickly and get any air bubbles out of the frosting before it sets. I would create a thin outline on the cookie using the frosting, let that set for 5 mins... <a href ="intro_readmore"><a href="" target="_blank">read more </a> </p>

      <!-- I would then take a modest heap of the frosting in the center and work your way outwards, touching the edge. I adapted this recipe from one I found previously. The thing about icing is that it needs to be played with so feel free to add more sugar if the mixture is too thin. Trial and error.

  <a class="info" href="recipe.html#challah">Challah</a>
  <p class= "descriptions"> Challah to me is one of my favorite things to make. Besides making a beautiful loaf of bread, I feel a direct connection to my ancestry and family history. Challah, or the braided bread, has a significant role in Jewish history. <!-- First cited in the Bible (Numbers 15:18-21), it is used in reference to the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and the offerings given there. --></p>

The thickness of the Acai base gives it perfect weight to balance with the light toppings, complete with plenty of antioxidants. <!-- The Acai base I found that is kosher is Sambuzon. As always, please check each time you purchase to make sure items are still kosher. Enjoy! --></p>

  <!-- <hr class="primary"> -->
  <h3 class="intro-heading"> ME</h3>

  <div class="explanation">
    <p>This blog is especially close to my heart as I became kosher at the age of 12 on my own. Luckily my family has been supportive along the way, but it has definitely been a journey being one of the only Jewish students in my high school, the only student on my university campus receiving kosher meals (they have since instituted a kosher meal plan :)), and one of the only religious people at work. Through it all my faith has fueled me and I truly enjoy this practice of Judaism. My goal is to inspire others and let them know that they can in fact have their cake and eat it too :)</p>
