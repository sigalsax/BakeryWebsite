  <div class= "about box">

    <p> Hello and welcome to the Kosher Wanderer. Yes, the Jews wandered in the desert for 40 years. Every pun is intended. Glad you made it.</p>
    <p> For starters as a disclaimer I wanted to outline what this blog is and what it is not, for reference.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="what-it-is box">
    <h3 class="intro-heading">WHAT IT IS:</h3>
    <p>- This blog is the first resource of its kind (that I could find) outlining what its like keeping kosher in a 1) foreign country with little kosher resources 2) for a substantial amount of time (8 days, including Sabbath)</p>
    <p>- This blog is meant to give inspiration for those willing to travel the world, but might be apprehensive in doing so because of the fear of difficulty of keeping kosher abroad</p>
    <p>- This blog is meant to be a springboard for creativity and finding random kosher items across the globe for people who love to travel AND eat (kosher).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="what-this-blog-is-not box">
    <h3 class="intro-heading">WHAT THIS BLOG IS NOT:</h3>
    <p>- This blog is not intended to be a one-size- fits-all and the author is not by any means a religious authority and local Orthodox Rabbis should be consulted on a case-by- case basis.</p>
    <p>- This blog is not intended to be adhered to strictly in terms of food options as these options listed were available to me during the time of the trip and in preparation for the trip. The posting of the food items does not endorse any brand nor type of food.
    </p>
    <p>- This blog is by no means intended to be deemed as “healthy” and the nutritional intake was not considered, but was instead thought of as providing nourishment during this time to suit my preferences and sustain me on my adventures.</p>
    <p>- This blog is not intended to portray kosher in a way of a be all end all situation. Judaism values life and in case of an emergency or life threatening situation, kosher laws can be accommodated. Again, please consult your Rabbi for this.</p>
  </div>

  <div class= "What-is-kosher box">
    <h3 class ="intro-heading">BUT FIRST, WHAT IS KOSHER?</h3>
    <p>Kosher is the Jewish set of laws pertaining to dietary restrictions. Coming from G-d at Mount Sinai, kosher laws outline what a Jewish person is to eat and how food is prepared. Some basic laws include </p>

    <ol>
      <li>prohibition of mixing milk and meat (and waiting in between eating each) </li>
      <li>eating land animals that chew their cud and have split hooves </li>
      <li>fish must have fins and scales </li>
      <li>birds eaten cannot be birds of prey. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Those are the basics. Then the laws go further into the preparation of food, how to keep a kosher kitchen, and so on. I encourage you to visit this  <a href="http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard_cdo/aid/113425/jewish/What-is-Kosher.htm"  target="_blank"> website </a> to learn more! But basically, keeping kosher is straightforward on most occasions and manageable when keeping it in one’s home or a place where a kitchen can be managed.</p>

  <h1 class="section-heading-center-about"> ABOUT ME </h1>
  <!-- <hr class="primary"> -->
  <h3 class="intro-heading"> ME</h3>

  <div class="explanation">
    <p>This blog is especially close to my heart as I became kosher at the age of 12 on my own. Luckily my family has been supportive along the way, but it has definitely been a journey being one of the only Jewish students in my high school, the only student on my university campus receiving kosher meals (they have since instituted a kosher meal plan :)), and one of the only religious people at work. Through it all my faith has fueled me and I truly enjoy this practice of Judaism. My goal is to inspire others and let them know that they can in fact have their cake and eat it too :)</p>
