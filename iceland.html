  <h3 class="intro-heading"> Iceland. The Land of Fire and Ice.</h3>

  <p>  What happens when you take a kosher person and plop them in the middle of <b> Iceland</b>? </p>
  <p>...That is exactly what I wanted to discover. Yes I keep kosher and yes I have an appetite for travel. I have lived abroad in Rome and had the luxury of the kosher restaurants, stores, and bakeries while there. Even though they weren’t conveniently located to where I was living, I was quite fortunate to have such access. After a few short trips around Europe, I realized I could survive for few days on
  power bars and other kosher items.</p>

  <p> About two years after that adventure, I was itching to get back and travel some more. But this time I didn’t want to go back to Europe proper… I wanted to go to <b> Iceland </b> (even though its considered European). After planning an exciting, crazy adventure to Iceland with one of my friends, I immediately realized I would need to craft a food prep plan as I keep strictly kosher and the trip would last for 8 days <b>(no, there was no correlation to Chanukah)</b>. My past experiences and travels had only been for a maximum of 2.5 days so I realized I would need a <b>PLAN</b>.
</div>

<div class="box">
  <h3 class="intro-heading-rome"> Executing the PLAN </h3>

  <p> When in doubt, go to Costco. As I was roaming the aisles of Costco looking for some divine food inspiration, I found a box of Kind bars and a box of individually packed nuts <b>(almonds, peanuts, cashews, walnuts)</b>. I figured that would be a good start and energy source. </p>
</div>

<div class="iceland box">
  <img src= "images/IMG_1569.JPG" id="iceland1">
  <p> Then, I visited the local kosher store and stocked up on 9 different instant soups to be used as a “warm” meals while in <b>Iceland</b> as even in the beginning of the summer temperatures can dip to the high 30s and 40s Fahrenheit. Additionally, you can’t forget Shabbos and since you are not allowed to bring alcohol through customs, my Rebbetzin <b>(my Rabbi’s wife)</b> suggested I buy grape juice boxes (the ones they sell for kids). So I snagged a pack of that. On the Shabbos note, I also brought sliced bread and candles to properly bring in Shabbos. </p>

  <p>A fellow kosher traveler suggested I stock up on tuna packets as a good source of protein. So I bought 5 packets of non-perishable tuna packets to give myself some variation during the trip.
  <p>My lovely mother also sent a full jar of cashew butter for added variation and protein. I highly recommend bringing a jar of your favorite nut butter (peanut, almond, cashew). It can be eaten with many different things and is an excellent source of energy. </p>


  <p>So all in all, I brought many different items as I am under the impression that you can never have too much food. That being said my food packing list included: </p>


  <ul>
  <li> 25 Kind bars </li>
  <li> 15 packs of nuts </li>
  <li> 9 instant soups </li>
  <li> 10 slices of bread (couldn’t fit a whole loaf in my bag, or else I would have) </li>
  <li> 2 grape juice boxes </li>
  <li> 1 jar of cashew butter </li>
  </ul>

  <i>Shout out to Travel BUDDY</i> 

  <p>First off, I would like to give my travel buddy a huge shout out. Not only was she game to travel the world with me, she was game to travel with someone who keeps kosher AND Shabbat. Travel buddy is not Jewish, but is unbelievably accepting and accommodating of my observances and I could not have asked for a better travel buddy. Truly. <p>

  <p>This is probably my biggest piece of advice (besides the food itself) when traveling under these circumstances…make sure you are honest and upfront about expectations with your travel buddy (Jewish or not) and that they are willing to be accommodating to those needs. Yes, keeping kosher is difficult at times and inconvenient so having someone who understands and does not get frustrated is key to enjoying the trip and for being an equal travel buddy. </p>

<div class="iceland box">
  <h3 class="intro-heading"> The TRIP </h3>
  <img src= "images/reykjavik.JPG" id="iceland1">
    <p>Luckily my plan worked and we made it through customs and security without any issue. <b>*Note:</b> The items I put in my luggage were the grape juice boxes (because of the liquid), the candle (because, duh), and some soups that didn’t fit in my carry on. I highly recommend checking the customs requirements for countries you plan on visiting. At the time of my trip, the Iceland customs requirements can be found <a href ="http://www.kefairport.is/english/at-the-airport/before-departure/customs-regulations/" target="_blank">here. </p></a>
  <p>We landed in Reykjavik and checked into our first location for the night. For the purposes of this page I am not going to go day by day, but instead give you an overview of various meals eaten during the trip. Itinerary coming soon! </p>

<div class="box">
  <h3 class="intro-heading"> Kosher Items Found in Iceland </h3>
  <p>Iceland is interesting in the sense that I found the most random foods that were kosher. <p>

  <ol>
  <li>Cereals – Regular Cheerios, Honey Nut Cheerios, Cocoa Puffs </li>
  <li>Shop Rite canned items – including sliced carrots and corn</li>
      <ul>
          <li>The added variety of a breakfast food helped and we often snacked on the cereals in the car </li>
          <li>Bought them but then realized I didn’t have a can opener/proper knife. Recommend bringing a can opener. </li>
      </ul>

  <li> Pop Chips - these were divine when food was losing its appeal </li>
  <li>Nature Valley bars – great for spreading with cashew butter and as a breakfast option</li>
  <li> Ben & Jerrys ice cream – for those who are not Cholov Yisroel, there were Ben &amp; Jerry ice cream options in every major grocery store (but they were quite expensive) </li>
  <li> Oatmeal </li>
  <li> Peanut butter</li>
  <li> Soy sauce – I have no idea either </li>
  <li> Popcorn kernels – same as above </li>
  <li> Fruits and vegetables </li>
      <ul>
          <li>Keeping the diet a little more balanced was key because the sodium from the instant soup was overwhelming after a while </li>
      </ul>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="intro-heading">My Meal Variations</h3>

<p> So as you will soon see, the meals can get quite repetitive over the course of 8 days. However, I tried the
best I could to have a balance to sustain myself through the hiking and adventures. </p>

<p>The asterisk after the foods indicate that these were foods I found while in Iceland. Those without
asterisks were part of the caravan of food I brought with me. </p>

  <h3 class="intro-heading">Nougats of Food Advice</h3>

  <ol>
    <li><b><i>Variation</b></i>. <b><i>Variation</i></b>. <b><i>Variation</b></i>. As you can see by the underlining and italicization, variation is a critical component of success while traveling kosher to remote places. Next time I do this I will bring more variations of potential foods, and fewer items for each option. Eating the same foods makes it harder to stay motivated so you learn to get creative (at one point I made myself a self- described “espresso float” in which I poured hot espresso over Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream. Points for creativity.) </li> <br>

<li> Hot water kettles. Various Rabbis hold different opinions regarding using hot water heaters at hotels and inns. If you are able to, I suggest bringing your own (which I did) or using the hot water kettles provided. Being in a relatively cold climate, having a warm (instant soup) meal was
a satisfying way to end the day. </li> <br>

<li> Expectations. Going into this adventure I ultimately had this blog idea in mind as a way to help others keep informed of ideas as well as act as a motivator for me during this trip. That being said, we only know ourselves best and setting expectations is key to a successful and enjoyable
trip. I (kind of) knew what I was getting myself into and had no real expectations of finding any kosher options (aside from fruits and vegetables) in Iceland so when I found certain things, it made it that much more exciting. When you dedicate your life and set your mind to something, it becomes a mindset which makes things easier. Being honest with yourself and admitting that sometimes it can be rough to observe the kosher laws is key because it allows you to feel human. </li> <br>

<li> Planning. Planning out your preferences, cravings, and dietary needs is critical in succeeding a week (or more) abroad in a foreign country. I outlined what I knew I needed to sustain myself and I recommend you do the same to make sure you are as satisfied as possible and most importantly, don’t run out of food. </li> 
</ol>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3 class="intro-heading">Feelings</h3>

  <dd> - Pride. I will say that being able to have kept up with this after 8 days is quite an accomplishments and the feeling of pride is a wonderful feeling. </dd>
  <dd> - Gratitude. It may not seem like a huge feat, but in the moments of adventure it definitely is. Through this experience I had gratitude to G-d, my situation, my travel buddy, and myself. Each were significant pieces of this experience and I hope this helps inspire others.</dd>
